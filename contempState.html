                <p>The world can be a bleak place when you stop to look around at headlines and what's happening in your
                    own community. As a children's librarian, you can make an impact, even in a small way, in making the
                    world a better place and improving the lives of children. Helping a child learn to read and create a
                    lifelong love
                    for reading and learning is such a rewarding way to spend your career. With a career in children's
                    librarianship, you could help
                    many children with reading, set up programs for children to make both friends and crafts, create
                    skills and
                    knowledge, and create a safe community space in which to spend time and grow their brains. With cuts
                    to funding,
                    children's librarianship is more important than ever, as some school libraries are being cut,
                    children's librarians at public
                    libraries may have to step in and fill that role for young children. There is also a children's
                    literacy crisis -
                    fewer and fewer children are reading at their recommended level, and as librarians it's our duty to
                    step in and
                    prevent this from furthering (Why Reading Matters – the U.S. Literacy Crisis, n.d.). Additionally, the standards for school libraries (similar, but not the
                    same as
                    children's librarians in a public library) are changing (AASL Announces the Second Edition of the National School Library Standards for Learners, School Librarians, and School Libraries, 2025). With these changes, different standards need
                    to be upheld. Read on
                    for more information on becoming a children's librarian.</p>
