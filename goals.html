                Goals of The Program
            </h2>

            <div class="s-lib-box-content">

                <p> The goal of our program is twofold: to provide resources for people who are unhoused in the Denver area and contribute to the temporary housing community, and to provide volunteer opportunities for local high school students, specifically students who have the skills that this nonprofit is looking for. We want to give these students the hours they may need as a graduation requirement but also increase their empathy as human beings. Many high school students are unaware how deep of an issue homelessness is, and volunteering with this organization can help them understand how giving back and making an impact can be very meaningful for them. Additionally, they are able to use the skills they’ve gained in their trade-specific high school to help others, not just for career purposes. 

More tangibly, the goals of this program are to get students volunteer hours, interactions with the patrons they are serving, building their empathy and understanding, and ability for them to flex the construction muscles they have built up during their time with Legacy Options. For the Colorado Village Collaborative and the unhoused people, the goal is to get more tiny homes built - not a specific number per se but enough that it feels significant for the nonprofit. Then by default, as these houses get built, the goal of creating spaces for unused individuals to live is met. The ultimate goal of the program is to get unhoused people housed and back on their feet, being able to utilize the programs that Colorado Village Collaborative can provide.
