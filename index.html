                <h4>Do you love children and reading? Do you feel joy in teaching children about the fun of reading and
                    encouraging learning and exploration? Do you excel at doing fun voices when reading out loud? Do you
                    want to see more cultures and people represented in books and media, and love to encourage diverse
                    voices? If you answered yes to these questions, you may be interested in a career in Children's
                    Librarianship! </h4>

                <p><span>Children's librarianship refers to librarians that specialize in Children's services and
                        children's content. School librarians are similar, but not the same. (School librarians work in
                        a school library, usually a media center). Those that specialize in
                        children's services often have a background in childhood development and in some countries
                        require additional librarian training. In the United States, there are over 60,000 children's
                        librarians, with almost 90% of these being women (Children's Librarian Demographics and
                        Statistics [2025]: Number of Children's Librarians in the US, 2021). Being a children's
                        librarian is very
                        rewarding, and involves creativity, compassion, exuberance, and passion for the job.

                            field, one of the heroes of Children's Librarianship, latest news, and more. There are also

                            professional development, and even some job listings to familiarize yourself with. Multiple
                            journals and articles are linked throughout this LibGuide in order for you to dive even
                            deeper in to Children's Librarianship and the work it encompasses. If you enjoy spending

                            path for you. </p>
