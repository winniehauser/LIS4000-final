                <li>Person-first language is a way to emphasize the person and view the disorder, disease, condition, or disability as only one part of the whole person. </li>
                    
                    <li>Describe what the person “has” rather than what the person “is.” Person-first language avoids using labels or adjectives to define someone. </li>
<li class="indented-item">Caution: there can be different preferences or strong opinions in the in-group – some may prefer homeless person, unhoused person, etc</li>
<li>Metro Denver Continuum of Care: Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson counties</li>

<li class="indented-item">64% of men were homeless between July 2022 - June 2023, compared with 34% of women who were homeless within that same time frame</li>
<li>Top contributing factors: relationship problems/domestic violence, family breakups, inability to pay rent or mortgage, losing a job/inability to find work	</li>
<li class="indented-item">Dwindling resources for financial assistance, the lack of affordable housing, domestic violence, employment challenges and issues with mental health or addiction</li>
<li class="indented-item">Families: high number are newly homeless, 1-3 kids, headed by women, trauma contributes to homelessness for more than half</li>
<br>
<li>Needs: career counseling, addiction counseling, therapy, food pantry, career clothes closet, family/kid-oriented activities, opportunities to learn new skills (creative, practical, soft, active), assistance navigating public housing & other programs, haircut event, access to healthcare, educational opportunities</li>
<li>Strengths: resilience, adaptability, resourcefulness, social intelligence, kindness, persistence, authenticity, humor, job skills, personal skills (e.g. music, sports), intelligence/education</li>
<li>Urban camping ban (since 2012, challenged in & upheld by courts, still enforced): encampment sweeps, tensions with Downtown Denver Partnership - business booster group that collaborates with the city on safety issue, being pushed from downtown to suburban neighborhoods like Montbello (communities with fewer resources)</li>
<li>Police & Street Enforcement Team: police are threatening, ticketing, and arresting more unhoused people than at any time in recent history; street enforcement team - unarmed group that has the power to cite and ticket people</li>
<li>All in Mile High by Mayor Johnston: to bring more than 1,000 people living in encampments into individual shelters like motel rooms and tiny homes or immediate housing through vouchers or connections with friends and family by the end of 2023</li>
<li>Stats: brought in 1,564 people, successfully housed 32% - of those, 70% had a bad outcome (returning to the street, jail, death)</li>
