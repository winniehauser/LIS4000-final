            <div class="s-lib-box-content">

                <p>Children's Librarianship originated in the 1940s and is accredited to the work of Anne Carroll
                    Moore with the New York Public Library. She was a pioneer of children's libraries and was
                    present when the first
                    child received a library card. Previously, there had simply not been a space for children in the
                    library, as it was geared toward students and adults, and remained what is stereotypically
                    thought of as a silent place for study and reading (Lareau, 2021). Children's libraries, at the
                    start,
                    emphasized a love for reading and wanted to encourage young readers in the community. These
                    libraries in America inspired libraries in other countries; wealthy Americans helped to build
                    libraries in Europe in the early 1920s as well.</p>
                <p> The emphasis in children's libraries is often on
                    “a belief in the uniqueness of each child; a belief in the crucial importance of each child's
                    personal selection of reading materials; a belief in the children's room as "an egalitarian
                    republic of readers;" and a belief in literature as a positive force for understanding, not only
                    between individuals, but also between groups and nations” (Children's Libraries |
                    Encyclopedia.com, n.d.). In today's
                    society, there are many libraries worldwide that are solely for children, rather than a room or
                    area
                    inside of a traditional library. The importance of children's libraries continues to grow and be
                    studied. </span></p>

                Some Children's Librarian Statistics (ALSC Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Task Force, 2016)
            </h2>

            <div class="s-lib-box-content">

                <p>93% of children's librarians are women, and 85% are white. </p>
                <p>69% of children's librarians have an ALA-accredited Master's Degree.</p>
                <p>79% of children's librarians are straight or heterosexual.</p>

                <p>As children's librarians, it is up to us to make the library an inclusive space. We could definitely
                    use some diversity amongst the librarians, as well. </p>
